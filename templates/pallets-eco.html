        There are some criterias to respect before we can accept the project:
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Usefulness</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>The project must be a useful one</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Documentation</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>The project must be documented up to a nice level</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Tests</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tests must have high coverage and be easy to run</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        Then mail to flaskcwg at python.org with the project detail as well as why you want to relinquish the project.
